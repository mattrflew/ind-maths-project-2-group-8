- Organise model into a new notebook
- Make functions 

- ⁠fixing the avoidance rule so the movement isn’t so sudden
- Scaling of turbine size based on size of birds
- Determine if bird hits obstacle
- Change how we update avoid obstacle

- Set up test scenarios (do not need to visualise the simulations, just need to save the results)
