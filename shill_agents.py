def shill_agents(x_bird, y_bird, x_obs_in_radius, y_obs_in_radius, x_obstacle_list, y_obstacle_list):
    '''

    This function computes the closest "shill" agent(s) positions and their
    velocity vectors. It does so by:
        
    1. Computing the closest point(s) on the boundary of an obstacle to the 
       selected bird. This is a shill agent point.
       
    2. Identifying the two points on the obstacle that are on either side of
       a shill agent point.
    
    3. Calculating the unit vector perpendicular to the line formed by these 
       two points on either side of the shill agent.
    
    4. Ensuring the perpendicular vector points outward from the obstacle, 
       relative to the bird's position.
       
    Notes:
        The function works with knowledge that there could be multiple 
        positions which minimise the distance between bird and the obstacle,
        hence it finds multiple perpendicular vectors

    Inputs:
        x: Horizontal position of bird
        
        y: Vertical position of bird
        
        x_boundary: x-coords of obstacle points that are 
        within the radius of the bird
        
        y_boundary: y-coords of obstacle points that are 
        within the radius of the bird
    
    Outputs:
        x_d: Horizontal position of the shill agent
        
        y_d: Vertical position of the shill agent
